# Alarm On Wheels

A project to make waking up easy.


## The Inspiration

Waking up is something I struggle with. It doesn't matter how many alarms I use or whether I use a real alarm clock or not, waking up is not something I can just do easily. I don't know how I manage it but all the alarms get snoozed indefinitely while I continue napping.

This is a project that tries to make an alarm clock so annoying you have to get out of your bed and catch it to shut it off. It gives the alarm clock wheels to run away from you.

## Demonstration

The alarm clock is so obnoxiously loud and distracting that only the most determined sleepers would be able to sleep through it.

## Components Used

- Raspberry Pi 4B 4gb
- L298N Motor Driver
- 3s 2200 mAh LiPo Battery (to power the motors)
- 10000 mAh Power Bank with 20w Fast Charging (to run the Raspberry Pi)
- 2 Yellow DC Motors with Gearbox Attached
- 2 Yellow Wheels with Tires (they come with the DC motors as a set)
- 5v Buzzer
- Jumper Cables

Along with these having a soldering iron, a hot melt glue gun and any sort of superglue (I used Fevikvik) would be extremely useful.

## Design Process

The most time taking aspect of this project to me was the design and 3d printing part. I'd worked on programming Raspberry Pi's before so it wasn't much of a challenge.

I've elaborated on the hardware design aspect [here](./CAD/README.md)

I've also explained the code further [here](./Scripts/README.md)
