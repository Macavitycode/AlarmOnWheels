# The CAD

These are the cad files for this project. Use the .F3Z file to go through the history of the build. Use the STP file to import it into any 3d design software. Use the STL files if you want to 3d print the design.

## Design Considerations

I was new to 3d design as well as 3d printing so I wanted to make something using these techniques. These were the parameters I tried to work within:

- Make the bot so it doesn't fall apart
- Make the bot compact
- Make the bot 3d printable
- Can be built with just glue (Because I had it at hand)
- Does not need a separate caster wheel (Because I didn't want to buy it)
- Balance the bot such that the caster ~~wheel~~ bump doesn't take too much weight while keeping the bot stable

A lot of these considerations as you can guess were born out of my laziness as well as me trying to learn as much as fast as possible.


## Lessons Learnt

 - The major takeaway for me in this was that design on it's own isn't too difficult. But good design is extremely difficult. It's a time consuming process overall. I've come to appreciate the world of 3d design a lot more now.

- While designing for 3d printing take into account variables like nozzle size and warping, as well as the materials used.
  - The wholes in the cad theoretically big enough for the dowels, but because the nozzle is almost half the radius of the holes I was trying to make, the final print had tiny holes.
  - I could not use some of the parts I printed because of which I could not hold up the Raspberry Pi as planned, which caused some of my supporting dowels to get in the way of the ports I was going to use.
